# Major Project Proposal

Asteroids type game. (Space asteroid shooter)

## Must Have's List

-Ship that rotates and moves.

-Bullets that fire where the ship is pointing (with restriction on how far they can travel).

-Asteroids that come from a random direction and break up when in contact with the bullets.

-When something travels off of the screen, it is teleported to the oposite edge.

-Main menu with buttons / settings.

-Point counter.

-Set amount of lives.

-Game over screen.

-Background music and sound affects.

## Nice to Have List

-After ship thrust, ship decelerates without any further input.

-Different game modes (time limit, no shooting survival, aliens, ect).

-Possibly another retro game if I am finished asteroids and have time.

-Multiple ships with different abilities.
