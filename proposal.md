# Major Project Proposal

Asteroids type game. (Space asteroid shooter)

## Must Have's List

-Ship that rotates and moves

-Bullets that fire where the ship is pointing (with restriction on how far they can travel)

-Asteroids that come from a random direction and break up when shot.

-when something travels off of the screen, they are teleported to the oposite edge.

-Main menu with buttions / settings

-point counter

-set amount of lives

-game over screen

## Nice to Have List

-After ship thrust, ship decelerates without any further input
-Different game modes (time limit, no shooting survival, aliens, ect)
